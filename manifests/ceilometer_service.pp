#
# This class implements basic ceilometer services.
# It is derived from https://github.com/stackforge/puppet-ceilometer/blob/master/manifests/generic_service.pp
#
# It also allows users to specify ad-hoc services
# as needed
#
#
# This define creates a service resource with title ceilometer-${name} and
# conditionally creates a package resource with title ceilometer-${name}
